    <h3> My One Page Writeup: </h3>
    
    
    
    I downloaded wireshark on a linux vm hosted on my desktop computer. Since this is a VM, I have to use the virtual ethernet adapter as the interface. I started with the umass.edu website as instructed. I then went to youtube to see how the network traffic looks. It was interesting to see that the video streams were all using the QUIC protocol. I was hoping to be able to identify when the authentication took place. The output went too fast, but I think it was the 2 TCP packets that appeared very briefly.<p>
    
    I ran the IP lab. I ran the traceroute command and viewed the results. I am not really network oriented, so there was some confusion as to how I could identify what fragmentation occurred. Determining the host for each request was troublesome so I enabled name resolution. That made things easier to read.<p>
    
    I ran the DNS lab. In the lab I ran the commands on the given domain names. I also ran it to find my raspberry pi devices on my LAN. Running with the type NS did not give any results to find the pi. I assume I didn’t receive the results since I am querying by device name rather than some domain or ip. Running the nslookup without the NS type did give me the correct output. This is a handy utility to find my devices on LAN. I was really bad at stopping the wireshark output quick enough after entering the commands in the terminal. It took a few tries, but I eventually did it and got the packets for the nslookup commands.<p>
    
    I ran the HTTP lab. The results of the last modified data were a bit different for me, but that is probably because I run my VM in a different time than my desktop. The html2 would produce the http 304 not modified code. I never knew that before. At work I usually deal with 200 or 4xx html codes. I get the familiar 401 error in the html5 step.<p>

    I ran the TCP lab. I ran the tcp commands and found the ones that synced the server and client. I then read the tcp messages for the http messages. Those I found un the data section at the end of the message. It is interesting that the messages get sent kilobytes at a time as a stream. I would have expected that but never thought of it before. Of course, the acknowledgment needs to be sent after each message. However, I don’t understand why there are multiple acknowledgements after each message.<p>

    I ran the UDP lab. I didn’t really connect to any sources as there were UDP messages sent automatically by the machine. UDP seems to be the most common protocol when inactive.<p>

    I ran the SSL lab. I accidentally went past the instructions and am now the owner of a new air fryer. Luckily my credit card data was passed using the TLS protocol to amazon. I am assuming the data was in the Encrypted Application Data field inside of the TLS record layer.<p>
